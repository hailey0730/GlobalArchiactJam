The genre of my game is mystery. The player is playing the role of a character that has no memory and trapped in a cell of a dungeon in the medieval times. The goals of the game are to escape the cell by finding clues from the objects in the cell and solve them, and to reveal the story of the character. The player can explore the cell and interact with the objects. There will be descriptions and what actions can be done with the objects to provide clues for the player to solve them.
